# RAG w/ Gemini Tutorial

Welcome to the RAG with Gemini tutorial! In this project, we'll guide you through the process of creating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using the Gemini-Pro model. The best part? You can achieve all this with the free version of the API.

## Overview

This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozq9fK9Pn-s) is divided into two main sections, each designed to enhance your understanding and skills in working with Gemini.

### Part 1: Exploring ChromaDB as a Vector Database

In the initial section, we will delve into a comprehensive notebook demonstrating the utilization of ChromaDB as a vector database. By following along, you'll learn how to:

- Extract data from JSON or PDF files.
- Store the vector representation of data in ChromaDB.
- Utilize the embedding model to embed data chunks.
- Efficiently split large texts into manageable chunks using LangChain.

### Part 2: Building a User-Friendly Interface

The second part is all about interaction. We'll guide you on building a visually appealing interface that facilitates the interaction with the Gemini model. Throughout this section, you'll gain insights into:

- Creating a user-friendly interface using Chainlit.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of the following:

- Data extraction from various sources.
- Vector representation and storage using ChromaDB.
- Efficient text handling with LangChain.
- Interface development with Chainlit.

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorial, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- PyPDF2
- chromadb
- chainlit
- python-dotenv
- google-generativeai==0.3.2

Installed them directly from the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API Key

Before you dive into the tutorial, obtain your API key from [Google Maker Suite](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
